## How Compression relates to Fractals

<!-- [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/hg7bFiNvHS0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg7bFiNvHS0) -->

This video covers the application of incompressibility to fractal geometry. Namely, we introduce *fractal dimension*, *Kolmgorov complexity*, *algorithmic dimension*, and the *Point-to-Set Principle*. The video was animated using [Manim Community (v0.19.0)](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html). 

The primary script is `main.py`, with supporting methods located in other files.
