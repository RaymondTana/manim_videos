Otherwise known as **How Compression relates to Fractals**, this video covers the application of incompressibility to fractal geometry. Namely, we introduce *fractal dimension*, *Kolmgorov complexity*, *effective dimension*, and the *Point-to-Set Principle*. The video was animated using [Manim Community (v0.19.0)](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html). 

The primary Manim script is `main.py`.
